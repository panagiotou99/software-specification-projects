# Lock Control System for Canals: Requirements Specification

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Software Specification course (2IX20) of TU/e. I collaborated with a local dutch student. It involves the design and modeling of a control system for a sequence of locks in a canal. The focus is on creating UML models and a non-formal requirements specification.

## System Description
The control system is designed for a flight of locks, allowing ships to move between different water levels. The assignment includes modeling a control unit that interfaces with the lock systems, managing doors, slides, and sensors.

## Features
- **Requirements Specification:** Detailed specifications for the control software, considering various actors and exceptional behaviors.
- **Use Cases:** Organized use cases derived from requirements, presented in a use case diagram.
- **Class Diagram:** A model detailing the class structure of the control software with an informal description of design choices.
- **State Machine Diagrams:** UML diagrams capturing the behavior of the control unit, including normal and exceptional scenarios.
- **Sequence Diagram:** Describing the interactions needed for a ship to move through the lock system.
- **Activity Diagram:** Illustrating the process when a ship arrives at a specific lock.
- **Modelling and Verification Report:** A comprehensive report in PDF format, describing and motivating modeling choices, formalizing requirements, and discussing verification outcomes.
- **Promela Files:** Two Promela files (single lock system and multiple locks system) formalizing the properties of the control system. These files should be submitted in a ZIP file via the Canvas submission page.
